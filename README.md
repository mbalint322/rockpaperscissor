Rock Paper Scissor Game in JS

9th of May 2023: Now shows win count and announces winner when 5 points are reached.

Things to change: 
- Score refresh shouldn't be tied to clicking button
- Button should disappear or stop functioning once 5 points are reached. Should be replaced with a reset button.
- Design UI and story
- Could add more variety in victory / loss message depending on scourecount
